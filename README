Q: I have a pixmap background, but the applet looks like shit, what's up ?
A: Short: the panel is broken.
   The libpanel-applets panel_applet_get_background supposedly returns a
   gdk_pixmap that is the pixmap area behind the applet. Unfortunately,
   it's often full of garbage, and it's not even the pixmap area that 
   the applet covers, but looks like it's the top-left corner of the 
   background pixmap. There it looks like crab, use a more uniform background
   pixmap or a color.
